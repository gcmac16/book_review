### Attention and Effort

- Eckhard Hess noticed that pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort
    - they dialite when people do tasks that are hard
    - harder the task, more dilation
- In add-1 task, size of pupil varied reflecting changing demands of task
    - pupils contract as soon as answer is reached or subject gives up
- When asked to find letter k during add-one people always saw it at beginning or end of task (easier parts) but missed it 50% of the time during the hardest part
- The response to mental overload is selective/precise
    - system 2 protects the most important activity so it receives the attention it needs
    - spare capacity is allocated second by second to other tasks
- system 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes and make deliberate choices between options
    - system 1 detects simple relations and excels at integrating information about one thing
    - sysetm 1 can't handle multiple distinct topics at once annd sucks at statistics
- Switching from one task to another is effortful especially under time pressure
- The ability control attention is not simply a measure of intelligence
    - measures of efficiency in attention control predict performance of air traffic controllers and pilots beyond effects of intelligence
