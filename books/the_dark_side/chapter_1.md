## Panic

- Cheney participtaed in Reagan era program simulating survival scenarios designed to ensure continuity of US gov't in event of nuclear war w/ soviets
- In 9/11 war room Cheney never broke a sweat when managing tough decisions
- Only certainty of intel community in fall 2001 was that second wave of attacks was imminent
- Officials in Bush WH say it's impossible to overstate the sense of mortal/existential danger that dominated thinking of high ranking officials
- Having underestimated them one, Bush/Cheney demanded to see raw intelligence on Al-Qaeda
    - Proved too be a mistake to not have analysis before giving it to the president
    - Suffered sensory overload and paranoia from intelligence that was mostly garbage/uncoroborated
- From start of term Cheney had assumed charge of national security portfolio for administration since Bush had no experience
- Instead of demanding review of how they'd been surprised, Bush&Cheney turned to old conservative tropes saying there was too much regulation (intl law, civil liberties, president's powers)
    - Cheney had been chafing against constraints on president since Watergate scandal
- Cheney saw terrroist threat as such catastrophe that the end justified ANY means
- Cheney got top lawyers to come up w/ legal justifications for vast expansion of gov't power in waging war on terror
    - First time in history US santioned gov't officials to physically/psychologically torture US-held captives
    - Allowed for secret capture and indefinite detention of subjects
    - Called most dramatic, sustained and radical challenge to rule of law in american history
    - No position has ever done as much damage to America's reputation in the world
- America had previously been biggest champino of Geneva Conventions which had rules about how POWs should be treaeted
