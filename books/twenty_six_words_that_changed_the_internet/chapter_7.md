## American Exceptionalism

- Industry based on unfettered user content only possible in US
- Non-Western/Democratic gov'ts hold online intermediaries accountable
    - Iran - severe criminal penalties for ISPs that allow "crime-generating" content
    - Russia - service engines must block links to untrustworthy/irrelevant results
    - China - shuts down sites where rgulators objet to content

- Delfi
    - EU protects "mere conduits", qualifications are:
        - doesn't initiate transfmission
        - doesn't select receiver
        - doesn't select/modify the information
    - providers not liable if they don't know or act to remove or disable after learning of bad content
    - EU leans towards privacy, US leans towards freedom
    - Delfi: responsible for user comments because they encourage them and set rules for them
    - Basically the same as pre-S230 law
    - "Should have known" is problematic; possibility of hate speech means it should have removed comments without delay

- Right to be forgotten
    - Spain Google v. Gonzalez outcome was that search engines have to deindex upon request if violated individual's dignity/right to privacy
    - Could be outweighed if strong public interest in keeping material accesible
    - Google received 350k request to deindex 1.2M pages; approved 42% in 1.5 years
    - Fears are that it allows rich/powerful to airbrush online reputation
    - Burden on 3rd party transforms Google into EUs Censor-in-Chief
    - GDPR makes deletion baseline response to deindex request unless an exception applies

- Canad and Australia both have laws resembling pre-S230 US
- S230 uniquely American, Right to be Forgotten is uniquely European
