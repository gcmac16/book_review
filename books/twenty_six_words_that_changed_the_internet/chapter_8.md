## A Lawless No Man's Land

- Two good options for asserting that a defendant is not protected by S230
    - Plaintiff demonstrates defendant was an information content provider
    - Lawsuit stemmed from action of defendant other than publishing/speaking
- Worst part of S230 is lack of definition of "develop" and "responsible"
    - When is a platform responsible for content? Only when it creates it? When it encourages 3rd parties to create? 

- Roomates.com Case
    - Sued by Fair Housing Authority (FHA) for violating federal and CA housing discrimination laws
    - Asked users for preferences about gender/sexual orientation/race/religion and also had free form user content
    - Initial ruling that site was protected by S230 under core immunity similar to Corafano; asking the questions doesn't mean they provided content
    - Appealed to 9th circuit who ruled that S230 didn't apply b/c it asked questions inviting user to violate Fair Housing Act
        - did protect them from discriminatory content in "Additional Comments" sectino
        - Appeald to En Banc rehearing - En Banc means 11 judges instead of 3 and they don't have to follow existing case law of 9th circuit
    - En Banc had same result - Roomates.com was responsible for asking discriminatory questions and requiring subscribers to answer them to use service; but they aren't responsible for stuff in additional comments secion
    - Developing content = contributing to illegality of content
    - responsible because creation of profile page collaboration between site and user, thus not entirely created by "another" information content provider
    - Even though they're liable, didn't commit illegal discrimination because housing laws don't apply to roommate selection
    - Notable for narrower reading of S230 but didn't open the floodgates

- Accusearch
    - hosted service connectin users to researchers that could obtain phone records
    - sued by FTC b/c what they were getting for users protected by privacy laws
    - FTC alleged site used/cause others to use illegal means
    - Accusearch argued immunity under S230 because it was an intermediary/interactive service
    - Judge held S230 not applicable because FTC suit didn't treat Accusearch as speaker/publisher
    - Appealed to 10th circuit where ruled that 230 wasn't applicable because Accusearch helped DEVELOP the reports
    - Contributed to conduct of researchers by paying them to acquire records prohibited by law
    - Tough because intent-based approach removes immunity from sites that "specifically encourage" illegal content

- Both case notable for limits on S230, but both were outliers in that cases didn't involve standard defamation claims
