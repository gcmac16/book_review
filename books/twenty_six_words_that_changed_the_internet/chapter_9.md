## Hacking 230

- By targeting conduct other than speech plaintiffs try to get around S230 w/ claims like failing to warn of danger, breaking promises to remove harmful user content, improper business deals
- Easier to say suit targets non-speech than show site was responsible for development of content

- Barnes
    - Ex posted ads w/ nude photos and work phone number; Yahoo employee promised to take care of situation for her
    - Sued later for negligence and promissory estoppel
        - promisory estoppel = plaintiff relied on promise from defendant to detriment of plaintiff and reliance was reasonably foreseeable
    - Initially lawsuit dismissed under S230, 9th circuit overturned dismissal on promissory estoppel, not 230 grounds
    - Paradox of narrow 230 reading - had Yahoo ignored Barne's request they would minimize liability

- Modelmayhem.com
    - Woman raped after traveling for photoshoot; met people on the site
    - Sued for failure to warn; valid because S230 wouldn't protect site's own speech which a warning would be
    - Contractino of 230 in 2nd decade and decline of internet exceptionalism
