## Sarah Versus the Dirty Army

- By targeting women, racial minorities and other groups these attacks both harm and further weaken their voices
    - women were disproportionately the plaintiffs in the cases with the most disturbing facts

- "We are skeptical that S230 is really optimizing free speech. Gives irrational degree of free speech beneift to harassers but ignores costs to victims"
- Even w/ S230 Dirty Army mod Richie was liable for any comments he added, but protected from user-created content even if the site operators delete parts of posts
- Judge denied request to toss the case out
    - concluded S230 didn't apply because Richie encouraged allegedly defamatory posts
    - published only small percentage of user contributions 
- First mistrial, second time Jones was awarded $380k, appealed to 6th Circuit
    - unanimous opinion reversing decision that S230 didn't apply
    - ruled that judge incorrectly reasoned that website developed content by intentionally encouraging user content
    - correct test was whether website "materially contributed" to the illegality of the user content
    - Denying S230 to sites that encourage user content would harm consumer reviews site
- Fordham Law Review cited case that Congress should narrow the scope of S230 immunity
    - the site shouldn't be protected since it's only purpose of hosting defamation and privacy invasion

- If you can't sue site, can try to sue anaonymous posters
    - First sue anonymous defendant named as John/Jane Doe
    - Then get subpoena issued requesting data about poster, get IP address
    - Then subpoena ISP requesting name of subscriber
    - But! not everyone keeps IP addresses and don't alway get subpoena approved
- Robust freedom of speech can harm those who are the subjects of the speech
- New York Times v. Sullivan (1964) supreme court ruled that if plaintiff of defamation lawsuit is a public official they have to establish defendant made defamatory statement with actual malice
    - malice = knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard fo the falsity
    - later case Gertz v. Robert Welch court declined to impose actual malice requirement on private figures. one reason because private figures don't have access to "self help"
        - self help = using available opportunities to impact on reputation
    - commercial internet became a two-way interactive experience where angry citizen could publish opinions; became tool for self help
- best example of self help internet enabled is the #MeToo movement
    - W/O 230 facebook/twitter would be far more resrictive of content and may have had to take down metoo posts for fear of defamation
