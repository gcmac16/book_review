## Introduction

"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider"

- Come to mean that websites aren't liable for comments/pics/videos users post
    - There are few exceptions (federal crime, IP law)
    - retain immunity even if they delete some user content

- Written by Chris Cox (R-CA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) in 1996
- Hoped that by immunizing services from lawsuits, companies would adopt basic codes of conduct & delete inapporpriate material
- 6 out of 10 most popular websites couldn't exist w/o S230
- There are significant social costs

## Elezar Smith's Bookstore

- Farmer's Educational (1959)
    - TV station WDAY aired speech from politician calling people communists
    - Defamaition lawsuit filed
    - Could have ruled narrowly that secion 315 (Equal Time Act) required WDAY to air the speech so they can't be liable for its content
    - Instead provides two guideposts for determining whether neutral distribution is liable for content it didn't create:
        - Court wanted to avoid requiring private parties to censor 3rd party speech
        - Strong presumption for distributors - if they can't censor they can't be liable

- Smith vs. California (1960)
    - Sold "obscene" book 'Sweeter than Life' to undercover cop and found liable
    - If distributor liable for everything sold would lead to self-censorship
    - Ruling was that distributors can't be legally responsible for content they distribute w/o concrete demonstration of their scienter
        - scienter = intent, knowledge or culpable state of mind for illegality
    - Paradox where distributors turn blind eye to content so they can't be liable

- Osmond v. EWAP (1984)
    - Erotic Words and Pictures (EWAP) sold video claiming a pornstar was Osmond (Leave it to Beaver)
    - Osmond sued EWAP for defamation
    - Lost the case because he couldn't prove EWAP knew they were selling a film containing false statements againt him
    - EWAP was rewarded for ignorance, Smith rule incentivizes hands off approach for distributors

- Spence vs. Park Place Market
    - Spuce was well known lawyer who represented Dwarkin
    - Hustler ran issue w/ Spence as "Asshole of the Month"
    - This time PPM was found to be a legitimate defendand because Lynch knew of feud between Hustler and Spence and failed to stop selling magazine or investigate the matter
