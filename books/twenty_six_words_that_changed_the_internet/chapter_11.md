## Kill.Kill.Kill.Kill.

- Critics of free speech are right to point out that protections are exploited but security is a nebulous term that offers a pretext for preventing unpopular ideas
- Social media companies fail to block harmful post and critics blame S230; by protecting platforms the statute reduces incentive for them to proactively screen content
- ISIS murder examples
    - Tried to hold twitter responsible for radicalizing future terrorist
    - Wife of victim sued twitter for violating Anti-Terrorism act
        - claimed twitter's social network constituted "material support" instrumental to rise of ISIS
    - Twitter claimed this was straightforward application of S230
        - plaintiff's countered that claims didn't come from content but merely from Twitter's provision of accounts to ISIS + supporters
    - Judge rejected plaintiff's argument that direct messages weren't covered by 230
    - Also rejected other non-S230 arguments
        - even if they're just holding twitter liable for account creation, this is meaningless without actual content
