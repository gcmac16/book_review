## Chris and Ron Do Lunch

- Chris Cox and Ron Wyden were bipartisan friends who didn't like Stratton Oakmont Ruling
    - Wanted best people to clean up internet to be incentivized to do so
- Sen. James Exon had first internet reform bill
    - It was punitive and gov't would punish for speech
    - Wyden/Cox wanted companies to set the standards, not gov't
- Two main goals for legislation
    - Encourage companies to build services w/o threat of being sued into oblivion
    - Allow platforms to selectively monitor/remove posts w/o bearing responsibility for content of ALL posts
    - Believed market would lead to companies developing codes of conduct for their particular audience
- Exceptions to the bill
    - Doesn't protect against users' violation of IP laws
        - in 1998 congress passed law that would provide safety from copyright lawsuits if content is removed after receiving notice from copyright holder
    - Doesn't protect companies from enforcement of federal law
- Legislation prevented individuals recoveing damages from some of the largest companies in the US
- Bil had wide bipartisan support leading to little media coverage/fanfare
- Initially because Exon bill made it in, the Communications Decency Act was thought to be a disaster for Silicon Valley
- Then Supreme Court struck down Exon's indecency section
    - grounds were basically that it would cause burden among adults communicating between themselves
    - internet/user contnet different than radio/tv where content is controlled by a few companies
    - Presume gov't regulation of speech is more likely to interfere w/ exchange of ideas than encourage them
- Two very different ways to interpret the 26 words:
    - Treat all online servies as distributors where if a site receives notice but fails to remove speech, they are liable
    - Prohibition on services as speakers/publishers of 3rd party conent means platforms have ZERO liability unless an exception applies
    - Text of bill nor committee clearly indicated which interpretation would prevail
