## The Prodigy Exception

- New online services like AOL/Prodigy/CompuServe allowed users to talk to each other online
    - What steps should they take to control quality of information?
    - CompuServe took hands off approach; Prodigy enforced conduct standards
    - CompuServe had much better legal protection as a result

- CompuServe Case
    - Defamation lawsuit over newsletter on Prodigy; first suit on record seeking to hold online service accountable for 3rd party speech
    - CompuServe argued they were passive distributor
    - Blanchard (counsel for defendant) argued they were a publisher
    - Focused on questino of editorial control rather than scienter
    - Judge created two step test for protection from claims against 3rd party speech
        - Service doesn't exercise editorial control before content is published
        - No knowledge/reason to know of objectionable content
    - Essentially required notice to be given to company at which point they have to take action
    - Another example of incentivizing services to not moderate ANY content

- Prodigy Case
    - Stratton Oakmont (from Wolf of Wall St!!) filed defamation lawsuit over forum posts on Prodigy accusing them of fraud
    - Prodigy exerted editorial control over forums by saying they prohibited profanity, obscenity, libel and slander
    - Aggressively marketed this as competitive differentiation; but Prodigy claimed they weren't doing this anymore by the time of the lawsuit
    - Judge agreed they were acting as a publisher so they were a valid defendant; case was dropped by both sides
    - Opinion still failed to precisely artiulate where/how to draw the line between publisher and distributor
