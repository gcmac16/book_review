## Himmler's Granddaughter and the Bajoran Dabo Girl

- Batzel v. Museum Security Network (MSN)
    - Batzel was lawyer for artists; disgruntled contractor sent eamil saying she had claimed to be Himmler's granddaughter and that paintings she had were stolen
    - Ton Cremers made slight changes and published on Listserv, Smith (contractor) he didn't know it would get published
    - Batzel sued Cremers, Smith, MSN for libel, privacy invasion, distress
    - Cremers asked Judge Wilson to dismiss based on S230
        - Wilson denied saying S230 applied to interactive computer services but MSN wasn't an ISP but a content provider
        - Implies only ISPs are protected by S230 but text of bill doesn't support that reading (providers AND users mentioned in bill)
    - Appealed to 9th circuit; important because tech companies are in the 9th district
    - Ralph Nader's Public Citizen filed a brief stating WIlson incorrectly interpreted S230 by focusing on ISPs
    - 9th Court sent back to Wilson
        - Linked S230 to first ammendment, set stage for broad interpretation
        - S230 applies to providers & users; broad S230 immunity
        - Slight edits made by Cremers didn't jeopardize 230 protection because one of its goals was to protect sites that moderated/edited user content
    - Dissent from 9th (2-1 ruling) argued that S230 applied only if defendand has "no active role" in choosing 3rd party conetent
    - Case went back to Wilson
        - Nuance that if he ruled Cremers acted reasonably in assuming Smith intended to publish message he'd be protected by 230
        - Never ruled on this
    - Chris Cox thinks size and traffic should determine immunity
        - the big companies with lots and lots of user content should be immune, small sites hand picking content, maybe not
        - troubled by immunity granted to sties w/ role in creating content
        - not cause to ammend, more good than harm

- Carafano v. Matchmaker
    - Carafano was Star Trek actress, fan made fake dating profile saying she wanted sex and posted contact info
    - Matchmaker not liable for fake profile just because they display content in a different form than the user provides it
    - 9th circuit ruld not liable because users selected the content, not Matchmaker
