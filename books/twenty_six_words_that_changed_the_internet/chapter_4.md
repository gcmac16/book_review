## Ask for Ken

- Internet Exceptionalism - philisophy that internet is simply different from previous forms of media and provides more benefits therefore it should be subject to less regulation

- Zeran v. AOL
    - ads posted on AOL w/ shitty t-shirts mocking bombing of Oklahoma posted Zeran's phone number multiple times from new acounts
    - Zeran sued AOL for negligence, not defamation
        - Negligence = defendant failed to provide care of duty that lead to injury of plaintiffs
    - Argued AOL had duty to monitor for new posts after being notified by Zeran
    - AOL's counsel Carmoe relied only on S230 which was risky
    - Defense rested on getting judge to agree on two points
        - OKC posts were "information provided by another content provider"
        - Zeran's suit treated AOL as "publisher or speaker" -> harder of the two
    - Suit never said AOL was publisher/speaker, only that it was negligent distributor
    - This is limited interpretation of 230 that only protection is to classify services as distributors instead of publishers; thus responsible after receiving notice
    - Judge ruled w/ AOL dismissing suit
        - Distributors are just one species of publisher so labeling as distributor is attempt to treat them as publisher
        - Broad interpretation of S230 was first ruling on the books
        - Appealed to 4th Circuit
    - 4th Circuit upheld the dismissal
        - Distributors are subset of publishers; when a distributor receives a complaint they're thrust into the role of publisher
        - Concern that narrow reading would lead to self-censorship even though not a questino of the first ammendment
    - Wyden agrees w/ this ruling
    - Turend 230 into super first ammendment for online companies

- Child Porn Case - Russell
    - Richard Russel used AOL to advertise/market child porn
    - Florida supreme court ruled 4-3 that AOL wasn't liable based on Zeran
    - Majority heavily cited Zeran, claimed suit attempted to cast AOL as publisher/speaker
    - Dissent thought Zeran opinion was totally unacceptable interpration of S230
        - What good was it if service made aware of child porn can do nothing with impunity while reaping economic reward

- Drudge Blumenthal Case
    - Druge report distributed by AOL alleged spousal abuse of Blumenthal
    - New wrinkle was that AOL paid Drudge so he may not be "another" content provider
    - Judge ruled in favor of AOL; treat as publisher
    - AOL took advantage of S230 w/o accepting burdens congress intended
    - Perfect storm for ruling against S230, but they didn't
