### Passing the Mirror Test

- Three questions to ask before buying stocks:
    - Do I own a house?
    - Do I need the money?
    - Do I have personal qualities that make me a successful stock picker?
- People rareley lose money on a house
    - Do better research, stay for a long time, taxes
- Only invest what you can afford to lose without affecting your day-to-day life for the foreseeable future
- Things aren't clear on Wall St. If you wait until you have all the data it's probably too late to make money
- Price of average stock fluctuates 50% a year
    - If price is $50, likely to move between $40 and $60 
    - If you buy at 50, double down at 60 and sell at 40 you're fucked
- True contrarianism is waiting for things to cool down and buying stocks that no one cares about
- Learn to discipline yourself and ignore gut feelings
