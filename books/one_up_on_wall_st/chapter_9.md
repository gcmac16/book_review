## Stocks I'd Avoid

- Avoid the hottest stock in the hottest industry
    - price may rise quickly but will fall quickly as well
    - high growth industries attract smart competition; low/no/negative growth industries don't
- Avoid the "Next (blank)" (next uber, next facebook, ....) 
    - avoid the new one and the old one although the old one could be a turnaround play
- Avoid diworseifications
    - often don't know how to run other businesses
    - if new business is related to core business, can be OK
- Avoid whisper stock
    - If it's really a great deal today, will still be good in a year
    - Don't have to buy at the IPO to make money
    - IPOs are better for spin-outs since research is possible but risky for brand new entities
-Avoid Middlemen
    - if company has one large customer, could be fucked if they leave
    - Customer has leverage that could drive down prices
- Avoid exciting names
