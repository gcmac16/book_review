# The Making of A Stockpicker

- Don't listen to the pros
- Smart money isn't so smart. Dumb money is only dumb when it listens to smart money
- Reasons to ignore experts:
    1. Experts might be wrong
    2. Even if they're right you won't know when they sell/change mind
    3. Better sources all around you
- One tenbagger can make a portfolio
- Listen to your wife - this means investigate anything you hear about. Is it public? Who owns it? Are they public?
- Finding promising companies is first step: after that comes research
