## Designing a Portfolio

- For picking stocks to be worth it you should be seeing long term returns of 12-15% net of ALL related expenses
- Own as many stocks as there are situations where you have an edge and/or there's an exciting opportunity that passes all research tests
- 3 to 10 stocks is reasonable for a small portfolio
- Foolish diversity is the hobgoblin of small investors
- No fixed approach will work
    - holding losers and selling winners is dumb
    - opposite doesn't work out much better because current stock price is a bad indicator of company value
    - read above bullet again
- get out of situations where fundamentals are worse and price is up and into situations where fundamentals are good and price is down
- be a buyer when price is down 25%, not a seller
