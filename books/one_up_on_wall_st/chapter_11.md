## The Two Minute Drill

- With the exception of asset plays, something dynamic must happen to keep earnings moving
- For any stock you buy you should have 2 minute monologue on why you're interested that a child could understand
- What to look for in story varies by stock type
    - slow grower - why will the dividend go up?
    - cyclical - changing market/business conditions, inventories, prices
    - asset play - what are the assets? what are they worth?
    - turnaround - is turnaround plan working so far?
    - stalwart - p/e ratio ,recent price history, change in growth rate
    - first grower - where/how can it continue to grow fast?
- Asking about competition is a good way to find stocks
- hotel/restaurant stocks are good because competition can't sneak up; gotta build 1,000 buildings somehow
- don't invest in stories/promises. if they aren't already doing it then don't invest
- Wait to see if regional/local concept is successful elsewhere before investing. No point in buying until company has proven cloning/scaling works
