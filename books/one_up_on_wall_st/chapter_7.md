## I've Got It; What Is It?

- Discovery of a stock isn't a buy signal
- Investing without research is like playing poker without looking at your cards
    - only requires as much effort is buying groceries
- If considering a stock based on one product find out what effect the success will have on the bottom line
- Don't buy stocks in giants expecting to 4x in 2 years
    - Only exceptions are turnarounds which are themselves rare
- All else equal, you make more money on small companies
- Six categories:
    - Slow Growers: large/aging companies; grow same rate as GDP, pay dividends
    - Stalwarts: large companies growing 10-12% per year in earnings
    - Fast Growers: small/aggressive/new companies; grow 20-25%/year; big winners
    - Cyclicals: sales/profits closely aligned with business cycles; misunderstood
    - Asset Plays - sitting on something valuable the street ignores
    - Turnarounds - battered/depressed/bankrupt that rebound
- Slow Growers
    - When an industry slows down, so do the companies in it
    - No reason to have in portfolio
- Stalwarts
    - provide decent coverage in receptions
    - cap on returns (sell after 50% growth)
- Fast Growth
    - very risky; young companies can be overzealous and under-financed
    - small fast-growers risk extinction; large fast growers risk rapid devaluation
- Cyclicals
    - sales/profits rise in regular (maybe not predictable) fashion
    - autos/airlines, steel, defense companies (wars are cycles here)
    - can lose 50% quickly if you buy in the wrong part of cycle
    - most misunderstood
- Turnarounds
    - Stalwarts/slow growers that fell on hard times; may file chapter 11
    - Types of turnarounds
        - Bail us out or else (GM/Lockheed/Banks)
        - Who would have thunk it (utilities)
        - Little problem we didn't anticipate (3 Mile Island)
            - Stay away from tragedies where outcome is unmeasurable
- Assets are hard because you need to know stuff not on balance sheets
- Companies switch categories over time
- Basing strategy on general maxims is dumb
    - No generic formula exists that applies to all the categories
    - 50% is great for stalwart, terrible for high growth
- Categorizing is first step to developing story
