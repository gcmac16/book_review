# The Wall St. Oxymorons

- Institutional investors are homogenous and suffer from group think
- Lag between company performance and its stock being acceptable to buy
- If stock goes down but fundamentals are still good, best to hold on, better to buy more
- Dumb reasons big investors don't buy:
    - Doesn't fit into any industry
    - too small
    - No track reckord
    - Regulations
- Sometimes work off lists to avoid "diverse performance"
    - diverse performance = 2 clients of the the same fund have very different returns
- By design it's tough for big investors to get in early on small market cap companies
