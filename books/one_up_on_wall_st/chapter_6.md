## Stalking the Tenbagger

- The average person comes across a 10x prospect 2-3x/year
- Questions to ask everytime you do/buy something
    - Is this company public?
    - Who makes this? Are they public?
- Winning investments seem so unlikely we imagine they only happen in faraway places
    - Doctors invest in oil not drugs and vice-versa
- The person w/ the edge can always outguess the person without it
    - CAN not WILL
- Discounting = Wall St. euphamism for pretending to have foreseen surprises
- Things to look for:
    - turnaround in sales
    - hidden assets not on the balance sheet
        - assets/share > price
