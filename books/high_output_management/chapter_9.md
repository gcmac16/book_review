## Dual Reporting

- Key idea: people can report to multiple supervisors and that is ok, sometimes even necessary
- Matrix management - developed by NASA, core idea is that a project manager can exert as much influence as an IC on the project
- Need dual reporting for hybrid organizations need one manager for proudct and business decisions and another for techncial best practices
    - balances centralization/decentralization
    - peer group exchanges freedom for consistency/efficiency
- Multi-plane organization can have people in multiple org charts with various relationships. 
    - In task force person A reports to person B in BU B reports to A
    - provides flexibility and leverages tradeoff is time management
