## Modes of Control

- There are three different forces governing people's behavior at work: market forces, contractual obligations and cultural values
- Free Market Forces
    - Efficient and governed by self-interest
    - buyer wants lowest price, seller wants highest price
    - requires little supervision
- Contractual Obligations
    - contract betwen parties, exchanges efficiency for certainty
    - best for things where value is ambiguous
    - examples: employment contracts, tax returns, stop lights
- Cultural Values
    - environment changes more rapidly that rules can
    - group interest ahead of self interest
    - example: stopping to help car wreck; strategic planning groups
    - requires trust and common set of values and methods
- CUA factor
    - Complexity, Uncertainty, Ambiguity
- Best mode of control
    - Self interest, low CUA = free-market
    - Group interest, low CUA = contractual obligation
    - self interest, high CUA = NOTHING WORKS
    - group interest, high CUA = cultural values
- New Employee
    - self-interest is high, so give a job with low CUA
    - does well, gains group interest mindset then can be promoted to high CUA position
- Senior person hired from outside
    - new hire has high self interest because they are senior have high CUA work
    - Have to hope she buys into mission and/or gains control of job quickly
