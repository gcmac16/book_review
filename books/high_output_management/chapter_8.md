- Intel is Hybrid

    - BUs compete for resources in functional groups
    - Functional groups let BUs take advantage of specialists
- Good management rests on reconciliation of centralization and decentralization
- ONLY advantage of mission oriented is that BUs can be more intimately familiar with their business and change/update quickly
- All large organizations end up as a hybrid organziation - Grove's Law
