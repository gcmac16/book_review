## Planning

- 3 Steps of planning:
    - environmental demand - what do you need to produce?
    - present status - what will you be producing if you don't make any changes?
    - reconcile (1) and (2) - what more (or less) do you need to do what to produce what your environment demands?
- Environment
    - people that need your service (internal/external customers)
    - people that provide you capabilities (data engineers / other eng teams)
    - competitors - business analytics team
